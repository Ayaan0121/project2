     <div>Ole Kirk Kristiansen</div>
      <p id="Founder12">Ole Kirk Kristiansen (7 April 1891 â€“ 11 March 1958) was a Danish carpenter. In 1932, Kristiansen founded the Danish construction toy company The Lego Group. Over the course of his working life, Kristiansen developed his business from a small wood-working shop that sold household products into a wooden toy manufacturer. In 1934, he named the company Lego and defined its core principles. Lego would eventually transfer to the production of plastic bricks following the purchase of a plastic moulding injection machine in 1947. When Ole died in 1958, the management of the company transferred to his son Godtfred.
In 1916, Kristiansen bought the Billund Woodworking and Carpentry Shop with money he had saved and made profitable sales over the years. During the late 1920s, the business focused on restoring and developing new buildings, and also producing household goods for the local community. In 1924, Kristiansen's business was almost destroyed by an unfortunate accident. His sons, Karl Georg and Godtfred accidentally caused a fire to break out after tinkering with wood shavings. Consequently, both the workshop and the family home burned down. Following this event, Kristiansen decided to expand his business and planned the building of a larger workshop with a family apartment. By 1930, Kristiansen employed a small workforce to maintain his growing business.
During the early 1930s, Kristiansen's business suffered due to the onset of the Great Depression in Denmark. The drop in farming prices resulted in many of his customers being unable to afford his products. This decline in business forced Kristiansen to lay off staff in early 1932 until only seven employees remained.[3] The primary income, which was from sales of ladders and ironing boards, was shrinking in demand.[6] Eventually, Kristiansen had to dismiss his last worker.[7] In order to sell more products, Kristiansen made the decision to produce cheap wooden products, including wooden toys. Unfortunately, his business slipped into bankruptcy, but he refused to stop producing toys even when his siblings requested this as part of a bailout loan.[8] He decided to officially found an unnamed company (later to become Lego) in 1932
